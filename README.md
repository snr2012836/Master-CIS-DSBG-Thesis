# Master-CIS-DSBG-Thesis
This repository contains code scripts and notebooks for my Thesis at Tilburg University. The data which is processed and analysed therein is protected elsewhere and can only be accessed from them. You may download it in dta format (i.e Stata readable) from GESIS at https://dbk.gesis.org/dbksearch/sdesc2.asp?no=5931 . Other than that, kindly ensure that your computer has all the necessary packages to run the code laid out in the Python notebook and R script. Have fun!

Yeah, and don't forget to change the file paths at the end of the Python Notebook to your source folder, the R script depends on it.
